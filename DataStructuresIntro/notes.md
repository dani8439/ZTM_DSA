# Section Intro
What is a data structure? A data structure is a collection of values. 
Algorithms are the steps or processes we put in place to manipulate these collections of values. 

These two things are what allow us to write programs. 

# What is a Data Structure? 

A Data Structure is a collection of values. The values can have relationships among them and they can have functions applied to them. Each one is different in what it can do and what it is best used for. Each DS is good and specialized for its own thing. 

Can think of DS's as any sort of container. It's simply a file cabinet of different types. Have a backpack, drawers, fridge, folder, box. Put different things in each container. Wouldn't put my food in the drawer as it'll go bad. Wouldn't put all my files or a toy box it'll get crumpled up. Each container is specific to one thing, and that's what data structures are. A way for us to organize data so that we can go into the backpack and retrieve that data easily. Go into the fridge and get the popsicle fast. Can get something and retrieve something from the data structures. 

In programming we have a ton of data structures. Wikipedia article, can see loads. 

Blockchain at the end of the day is simply a data structure. A way to hold info. 

Can store numbers, strings, boolean types. Arrays and objects are types of data structures. 

Always trade offs every programming question has tradeoffs. Readability, memory and speed? Same thing with Data structures, one is better than the other, each one for its own specific case. Two parts to understanding data structures.

1. How to build one. 
2. How to use it.
